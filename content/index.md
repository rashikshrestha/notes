# About my Notes
Here are my study notes! I thought they might be useful to share. This is definitely not a polished tutorial or documentation, so brace yourself for any typos or errors. If you spot any mistakes, please let me know (rashikshrestha01@gmail.com). Even better, feel free to send **Pull Request** in [this repository](https://github.com/rashikshrestha/my-study-notes) if you do any correction, addition, deletion, or polishing to the contents. Also, if you have any confusion/queries, we can have discussion on [github issues](https://github.com/rashikshrestha/my-study-notes/issues).

I hope these notes prove helpful! üçª
